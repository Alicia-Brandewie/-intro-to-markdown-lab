# Medicating a cat

There are many wonderful experiences people share with their pet cats, but giving oral medication to cats is not one of them. Thankfully, there are multiple different methods to help the medicine go down (although a spoonfull of sugar is not one of them). 

## Step one: Talk with your veterinarian 

When your cat is perscribed a new medication, ask the veterinarian as many questions about the medication form as you can. There's a high likelyhood your vet and their staff are very familiar with the medication, and know if cats have any common responses or reactions to taking the medication. 


 Many medications comes come in both pill form and liquid form. If not, it's often possible for the veterinarian or a pharmacy -- many medications can be bought from your 'human' pharmacy -- to make perscription into a liquid form. 

> For example: my cat was perscribed a quarter of a tablet once a day. Cutting the tablets meant he could taste the medication, and his reaction was to drool excessivly. I mentioned this to the vet the next time we talked, and they were unsuprised because it known to be very bitter. The next time my cat needed it, they made it into a liquid form so it would not be bitter. 

* **For pills**: ask about the size, shape, and texture: a small, oblique, non-coated pill will likely be easier to administer than a large, round, coated pill. 

* **For liquids**: ask about the quantity, consistancy, and any equipment involved. A mililiter of a thin liquid is likely easier to administer than a half a mililiter of a very thick liquid. Most liquids come in a small, screwtop plastic bottle with a provided syringe. However, some come in glass vials or with special nozzles for controlling the flow. Also, ask if the medication can be flavored, just like children's medication. 

* **For other substances**, ask similar questions about quantity, taste and texture, and any special equipment. Veterinary medication can also come in gels, pastes, powders, and inhalers. 

* **For all forms**, ask your veterinarian if there are any restrictions on mixing the medication with food to aid in administering it. 



## Step two: feed flavored medication directly

If you have a flavored liquid, paste, gel, or powder medication, and a cat that isn't a picky eater, you may have lucked out. Offer the medication to your cat in their regular food dish, and chances are they will eat it asis. 

## Step three: mix with food

While step two is the dream scenerio, it's rare. You are very likely going to have to mix the medication with your cat's regular food, and most likely to have to mix it with a high-value treat. A high-value treat is something your cat absolutly loves to eat, and rarely, if ever, refuses. 

Examples:
* Wet cat food
* Wet kitten food (it's higher in fat, so very enticing)
* Specialty medication pocket treats that wrap pills
* Liquid cat treats or food toppers
* Small peice of non-seasoned, cooked meat
* Small peice of canned fish
* The liquid from canned fish
* Chicken, beef, or seafood broth
* Small peice of cheese
* Cheesewiz 
* Cream cheese, especially salmon flavored
* Butter

## Step four: get creative with the food
Is your cat eatting the treat but spitting out the pill or refusing to eat the mixed medication-broth all together? Cats have very sensitive pallates and noses, so any bitterness or change in texture may cause them to reject the food-medicaton combonation. Try a different food every time. Double the amount of treat you're using. Spoon feed your cat instead of placing it in their reqular dish. Put the food in the palm of your hand instead of their dish. Smear a small amount of liquids/pastes on the top of one of their from paws; if they lick their paw clean, continue smearing a small amount until they've eatten all of their medication. 

## Step five: direcly into the mouth
If the food methods do not work for you and your cat, or you have a wonderfully tolerant cat, medication can be placed directly into the cat's mouth, with human help in swallowing. 
1. Place the cat on a table in front of you or sit on the ground with the cat in your lap; either way, have the cat's back against your chest and their head facing away from you.
2. Hold the medication in your dominant hand, and the cat's head in your other hand. 
3. Tip your cat's head upwards, so gravity can assist the pill going down. 
4. Place your thumb at the back of your cat's head, your index finger on the side of their mouth, and your other three fingers under their chin. 
5. Push your index finger between the lips ot wedge open the mouth. The teeth in the side and back of the mouth are not as sharp as the front. 
6. Drop the pill or squirt the syringe as far back into the throat as possible.
7. Retract your fingers, and gently hold the mouth shut  with your nondominant hand. 
8. Stroke the cat's throat with your dominant hand until you feel the cat swollow. 

> Tip: Stay as calm as possible during the process. Take deep breaths, talk positively to yourself and the cat, and pet your cat before, during, and after. Cats are great energy detectors, so if you're collected and confident throughout the process, your cat will be too. 

## Step Six: get help
If your cat is still fighting, scratching, spitting out pills, and otherwise refusing to take the medication, time to enlist aids and/or another person. 
  ### Types of aids:
  * **Pill 'shooter'**. These come in a variety of designs and sizes, but they are all are dry syringes. The device holds the pill so you don't get bitten, and the thrust of the syringe pushes the pill further back into the throat. 
  * **Extra syringe full of water**. Drip a few drops of water into the cat's mouth before putting the medication in, so that the cat is already salivating and swallowing. Place the medication, then put the syringe in the mouth and gently drip water until the cat has swallowed. *This works best with the cat's head held vertically.*
  * **Towel or blanket**. Turn your cat into a *purrito* by swaddling it in a towel or blanket. Yes, swaddle -- place the cat on the blanket, so that all four paws/legs are tucked against its body, then wrap the blanket tightly so that no paws can escape. *The fluffier the blanket/towel or larger the area the better* this places enough fabric between you and the cat that their claws can't sink through the fabric. 
  * **Scruff** Like a mother cat, hold your cat by the scruff of their neck with your non-dominant hand, and use your dominant hand to open the mouth and place the medication. THis will partially immobilize your cat. Be gentle but firm, as too rough can harm your cat, and be sure to not choke them by accident. 
  * **Another person** Enlist another person to help, so you can concentrate on different responsibilities. One person holds the cat, while the other person delivers the medication. 

  

#### And remember, you're being a great pet parent, no matter how much your cat resists! Take your time, take breaks, and try different methods until you find what works best for you and your cat.
